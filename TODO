# new Operator (remainder %%)

**Remainder %%** work like **Module %** yet with one *unit different*,
the deference between them is how they choose the sign,
**module** always has the same sign as the **divisor**,
while **remainder** has same sign as **dividend**.

Examples:

```tstm
 7 %% 10  =  7
 7 % 10   =  7
 10 %% 10 =  0
 10 % 10  =  0
 12 %% 10 =  2
 12 % 10  =  2
-15 %% 10 = -5
-15 % 10  =  5
 8 %% -10 =  8
 8 % -10  =  8
-9 %% -10 = -9
-9 % -10  =  1
```

# new Feature (units `t)

**Units `u** are lexer function that take **x** a number and return result number.

Examples:

```tstm
15`deg      // this convert 15 degrees to radian
6.28`rad    // this convert 6.28 radian to something near 360 degrees
50`%        // this convert 50 to 0.5 float percentage
50`%%       // this convert 50 to 0.05 float percentage
```
