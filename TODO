# new Operator (remainder %%)

**Remainder %%** work like **Module %** yet with one *unit different*,
the deference between them is how they choose the sign,
**module** always has the same sign as the **divisor**,
while **remainder** has same sign as **dividend**.

Examples:

```tstm
 7 %% 10  =  7
 7 % 10   =  7
 10 %% 10 =  0
 10 % 10  =  0
 12 %% 10 =  2
 12 % 10  =  2
-15 %% 10 = -5
-15 % 10  =  5
 8 %% -10 =  8
 8 % -10  =  8
-9 %% -10 = -9
-9 % -10  =  1
```

# new Feature (units `t)

**Units `u** are lexer function that take **x** a number and return result number.

Examples:

```tstm
15`deg      // this convert 15 degrees to radian
6.28`rad    // this convert 6.28 radian to something near 360 degrees
50`%        // this convert 50 to 0.5 float percentage
50`%%       // this convert 50 to 0.05 float percentage
```

## Build fMath lib for all platforms

platforms:
  - ✓ windows
  - ✕ linux
  - ✕ macos
  - ✕ android
  - ✕ ios

build platforms and complete _libraryPath getter in `fmath.dart` file,

## C Main version

write the main version in c
and use c interop in other languages
only rewrite it in other language when it highly used yet have no c interop

## write Help message

write **help message** for each *builtin function*,
use help/print.txt as reference

## New Number kind (mask)

prefix 0m 0M

valid chars
0-9 oir OIR

How it work:

it basically repeat
O for repeat zero 0
I for repeat one  1
R for repeat part before


**Examples:**

0mO4I1 -> 0b00001
0mi1O2 -> 0b100
0mi3o1r5 -> 0b11101110111011101110
0miiior5 -> 0b11101110111011101110
0miiiorrrrr -> 0b11101110111011101110
0moiir2oor3 -> 0b011011000110110001101100

**Clear format:**

OIIR2OOR3
((0¹1²)²0²)³

**What is For?:**

 - easier to generate and understand masks
 - new color masking trick
 - better binary level control of colors and numbers
